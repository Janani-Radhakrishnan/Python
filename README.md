**Title: MySQL Database Manager in Python**

**Description:**
This repository contains Python scripts for managing MySQL databases and performing basic CRUD operations. The implementation includes a modular approach with the following features:

-->Database Initialization and Connection Management: Establish and manage a connection to a MySQL server using mysql-connector.
-->Database Operations: Create databases, switch between them, and display available databases.
-->Table Management: Create tables with custom schemas and check if they exist.
-->Data Operations: Insert and fetch data from tables with dynamic input support.
-->Clean Closure: Properly close the database connection after operations.

**Files:**

1. main.py: A driver script that demonstrates how to use the Database class for various operations like creating databases, tables, and performing data manipulations.
2. sample.py: A Python module containing the Database class, which encapsulates all MySQL operations.

**Usage:**
Ensure you have the following requirements installed:

-->Python 3.x
-->mysql-connector library (pip install mysql-connector-python)
-->A running MySQL server with appropriate credentials.

Run main.py to execute predefined database operations or modify the script to suit your requirements.
